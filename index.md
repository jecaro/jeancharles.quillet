# Welcome !

My name is Jean-Charles. I'm a passionate professional software developer.

I've got a wide range of experiences that helps me to address most software
related problems. At the beginning of my career, I've worked as a system
administrator and web developer for a web startup in 2002. I've built security
software in New-Zealand. I worked in computer graphics on mobile devices for
the French research institute the [INRIA](https://inria.fr). I developed a
bunch of simulation software in a sub-contractor company for the French MoD,
and various research laboratories.

Now I develop cloud based network security software in Haskell for the great
folks of [Secucloud](https://www.linkedin.com/company/secucloud/).

and feel free to [reach out](/pages/contact.html) for any matter.
